# AnBuddy - Mental Health Support Chatbot

## Project Overview

**AnBuddy** is a comprehensive React Native application designed to provide mental health support through an AI-powered chatbot interface. The project demonstrates full-stack development capabilities, integrating a React Native frontend with a Flask-based backend API.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React Native)
- **Framework**: React Native with TypeScript
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v7 with stack navigator
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- **UI/UX**: Custom components with animations and theming
- **API Integration**: Fetch-based HTTP client with error handling
- **Testing**: Jest with React Test Renderer

### Backend (Flask)
- **Framework**: Flask with CORS support
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo API
- **Fallback System**: Contextual responses when AI is unavailable
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and logging

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Intelligent Chat Interface
- **Real-time Messaging**: Live conversation with typing indicators
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history for coherent responses
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Uses OpenAI for empathetic, mental health-focused responses
- **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

### 2. Emergency Support System
- **SOS Button**: Prominent emergency access with animated feedback
- **Crisis Hotlines**: Integration with national suicide prevention and crisis support
- **Contact Management**: Dynamic loading of emergency contacts from API
- **Call Integration**: Ready for phone number dialing functionality

### 3. User Experience
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Adaptive theming based on system preferences
- **Connection Status**: Visual feedback for backend connectivity
- **Offline Mode**: Graceful handling of network issues
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes

### 4. Technical Excellence
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
- **Performance**: Optimized animations and efficient re-renders
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation

## Code Quality Highlights

### Frontend Architecture
```typescript
// Modular API service with type safety
export class ApiService {
  async sendMessage(message: string, conversationHistory: Message[]): Promise<ChatResponse>
  async getEmergencyContacts(): Promise<EmergencyContact[]>
  async testConnection(): Promise<{ connected: boolean; message: string }>
}

// Custom hooks for state management
const useChatState = () => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>([])
  const [isTyping, setIsTyping] = useState(false)
  const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState(false)
  // ... implementation
}
```

### Backend Design
```python
# Mental health-focused conversation context
MENTAL_HEALTH_CONTEXT = """
You are AnBuddy, a compassionate AI mental health companion. Your role is to:
1. Provide empathetic and supportive responses
2. Help users process their emotions
3. Offer coping strategies when appropriate
4. Recognize when professional help might be needed
"""

# Robust error handling with fallbacks
def get_openai_response(user_message, conversation_history=None):
    try:
        # OpenAI API call
        return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"OpenAI API error: {e}")
        return None
```

## Technical Decisions & Justifications

### 1. Flask over Rasa
**Decision**: Used Flask with OpenAI instead of Rasa
**Rationale**: 
- Better compatibility with Python 3.13
- More flexible and customizable
- Easier deployment and maintenance
- Direct control over AI responses and mental health context

### 2. TypeScript Implementation
**Decision**: Full TypeScript adoption
**Rationale**:
- Enhanced developer experience and code quality
- Better IDE support and error catching
- Improved maintainability for team development
- Type safety for API responses and state management

### 3. Custom API Service
**Decision**: Built custom API client instead of using libraries
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and performant
- Full control over error handling
- Easy to customize for specific requirements
- No external dependencies for HTTP requests

### 4. Fallback System
**Decision**: Implemented contextual fallback responses
**Rationale**:
- Ensures app functionality even when AI services are down
- Mental health-specific responses for different emotional states
- Better user experience during network issues
- Maintains app reliability

## Performance Optimizations

### Frontend
- **Memoization**: React.memo for expensive components
- **Lazy Loading**: Dynamic imports for non-critical features
- **Animation Optimization**: useNativeDriver for smooth animations
- **State Management**: Efficient state updates and minimal re-renders

### Backend
- **Response Caching**: Conversation history management
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation strategies
- **API Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse
- **Resource Management**: Efficient memory usage

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- **Environment Variables**: Secure API key management
- **Input Validation**: Sanitized user inputs
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing
- **Error Sanitization**: No sensitive data in error messages

### Future Enhancements
- **Authentication**: User login and session management
- **Rate Limiting**: API usage restrictions
- **Data Encryption**: End-to-end message encryption
- **Audit Logging**: Security event monitoring

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```typescript
// API service testing
test('sends message successfully', async () => {
  const response = await apiService.sendMessage('Hello', [])
  expect(response.success).toBe(true)
  expect(response.response).toBeDefined()
})
```

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint testing with real HTTP requests
- Component testing with React Test Renderer
- Error scenario testing and fallback validation

## Deployment Architecture

### Development
- **Local Development**: Flask server on localhost:5000
- **Hot Reloading**: Metro bundler for React Native
- **Debug Tools**: React Native Debugger and Chrome DevTools

### Production Ready
- **Backend**: Deployable to Heroku, AWS, or similar platforms
- **Frontend**: Buildable for iOS App Store and Google Play Store
- **Environment Management**: Separate configs for dev/staging/prod

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Architecture
- **Stateless Backend**: Easy horizontal scaling
- **Client-Side State**: Minimal server resource usage
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new features

### Future Scalability
- **Database Integration**: For user profiles and conversation history
- **Microservices**: Separate services for different features
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple backend instances
- **CDN Integration**: For static assets and caching
